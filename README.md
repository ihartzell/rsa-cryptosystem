# rsa-cryptosystem

## What The Program Does?
Solves a crypto system containing over 200 cipher text blocks, and gives the plaintext in chunks\
int a text document.

## Background
This problem was assigned as an extra credit problem, and a classmate and I decided to figure out\
how to write the program to solve it rather than solving by hand which would be extremely time consuming.\
He wrote his own version in c++ and I wrote my version in python.
